\begin{abstract}
Constraining the frequency of energy deposition in magnetically-closed \AR{} cores requires sophisticated hydrodynamic simulations of the coronal plasma and detailed forward modeling of the optically-thin line-of-sight integrated emission.
However, understanding which set of model inputs best matches a set of observations is complicated by the need for any proposed heating model to simultaneously satisfy multiple observable constraints.
In this paper, we train a random forest classification model on a set of forward-modeled observable quantities, namely the emission measure slope, the peak temperature of the emission measure distribution, and the time lag and maximum cross-correlation between multiple pairs of AIA channels.
We then use our trained model to classify the heating frequency in every pixel of \AR{} NOAA 1158 using the observed emission measure slopes, peak temperatures, time lags, and maximum cross-correlations and are able to map the heating frequency across the entire active region.
We find that high-frequency heating dominates in the inner core of the \AR{} while intermediate frequency dominates closer to the periphery of the \AR{}.
Additionally, we assess the importance of each observed quantity in our trained classification model and find that the emission measure slope is the dominant feature in deciding with which heating frequency a given pixel is most consistent.
The technique presented here offers a very promising and widely applicable method for assessing observations in terms of detailed forward models given an arbitrary number of observable constraints.
