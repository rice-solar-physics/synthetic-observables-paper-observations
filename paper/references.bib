  abstract = {The recent analysis of observations taken with the EUV Imaging Spectrometer and X-Ray Telescope instruments on Hinode suggests that well-constrained measurements of the temperature distribution in solar active regions can finally be made. Such measurements are critical for constraining theories of coronal heating. Past analysis, however, has suffered from limited sample sizes and large uncertainties at temperatures between 5 and 10~MK. Here we present a systematic study of the differential emission measure distribution in 15 active region cores. We focus on measurements in the inter-moss region, that is, the region between the loop footpoints, where the observations are easier to interpret. To reduce the uncertainties at the highest temperatures we present a new method for isolating the Fe XVIII emission in the AIA/SDO 94 \AA{} channel. The resulting differential emission measure distributions confirm our previous analysis showing that the temperature distribution in an active region core is often strongly peaked near 4~MK. We characterize the properties of the emission distribution as a function of the total unsigned magnetic flux. We find that the amount of high-temperature emission in the active region core is correlated with the total unsigned magnetic flux, while the emission at lower temperatures, in contrast, is inversely related. These results provide compelling evidence that high-temperature active region emission is often close to equilibrium, although weaker active regions may be dominated by evolving million degree loops in the core.},

  abstract = {Despite significant progress in understanding the dynamics of the corona, there remain several unanswered questions about the basic physical properties of coronal loops. Recent observations from different instruments have yielded contradictory results about some
characteristics of coronal loops, specifically as to whether the observed loops are spatially resolved. In this paper, we examine the evolution of coronal loops through two extreme-ultraviolet filters and determine if they evolve as a single cooling strand. We measure the temporal evolution of eight active region loops previously studied and found to be isothermal and resolved by Aschwanden \& Nightingale. All eight loops appear in "hotter" TRACE filter images (Fe XII 195 \AA{}) before appearing in the "cooler" (Fe IX/Fe X 171 \AA{}) TRACE filter images. We use the measured delay between the two filters to calculate a cooling time and then determine if that cooling time is consistent with the observed lifetime of the loop. We do this twice: once when the loop appears (rise phase) and once when it disappears (decay phase). We find that only one loop appears consistent with a single cooling strand and hence could be considered to be resolved by TRACE. For the remaining seven loops, their observed lifetimes are longer than expected for a single cooling strand. We suggest that these loops could be formed of multiple cooling strands, each at a different temperature. These findings indicate that the majority of loops observed by TRACE are unresolved.},

  abstract = {The coronal heating mechanism for active region core loops is difficult to determine because these loops are often not resolved and cannot be studied individually. Rather, we concentrate on the "inter-moss" areas between loop footpoints. We use observations from the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer and the X-Ray Telescope to calculate the emission measure distributions of eight inter-moss areas in five different active regions. The combined data sets provide both high- and low-temperature constraints and ensure complete coverage in the temperature range appropriate for active regions. For AR 11113, the emission can be modeled with heating events that occur on timescales less than the cooling time. The loops in the core regions appear to be close to equilibrium and are consistent with steady heating. The other regions studied, however, appear to be dominated by nanoflare heating. Our results are consistent with the idea that active region age is an important parameter in determining whether steady or nanoflare heating is primarily responsible for the core emission, that is, older regions are more likely to be dominated by steady heating, while younger regions show more evidence of nanoflares.},

The basis of EBTEL is the modeling of mass exchange between the corona and transition region (TR) and chromosphere in response to heating variations, with the key parameter being the ratio of the TR to coronal radiation. We develop new models for this parameter that now include gravitational stratification and a physically motivated approach to radiative cooling. A number of examples are presented, including nanoflares in short and long loops, and a small flare. The new features in EBTEL are important for accurate tracking of, in particular, the density. The 0D results are compared to a 1D hydro code (Hydrad) with generally good agreement. EBTEL is suitable for general use as a tool for (1) quick-look results of loop evolution in response to a given heating function, (2) extensive parameter surveys, and (3) situations where the modeling of hundreds or thousands of elemental loops is needed. A single run takes a few seconds on a contemporary laptop.},

solar active region using instruments on Hinode and the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO). These multi-instrument observations allow us to
determine the distribution of plasma temperatures and follow the
evolution of emission at different temperatures. We find that at the
apex of the high-temperature loops the emission measure distribution is
strongly peaked near 4 MK and falls off sharply at both higher and lower
temperatures. Perhaps most significantly, the emission measure at 0.5 MK
is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude from the peak at 4 MK.
We also find that the temporal evolution in broadband soft X-ray images
is relatively constant over about 6 hr of observing. Observations in the
cooler SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) bandpasses generally do
not show cooling loops in the core of the active region, consistent with
the steady emission observed at high temperatures. These observations
suggest that the high-temperature loops observed in the core of an
active region are close to equilibrium. We find that it is possible to
reproduce the relative intensities of high-temperature emission lines
with a simple, high-frequency heating scenario where heating events
occur on timescales much less than a characteristic cooling time. In
contrast, low-frequency heating scenarios, which are commonly invoked to
describe nanoflare models of coronal heating, do not reproduce the
relative intensities of high-temperature emission lines and predict
low-temperature emission that is approximately an order of magnitude too
large. We also present an initial look at images from the SDO/AIA 94

The intensities and velocities measured in the cores of quiescent active

heating scenario that has been proposed to reconcile such observations
with impulsive heating models is the "long nanoflare storm," where
short-duration heating events occur infrequently on many sub-resolution
strands; the emission of the strands is then averaged together to
explain the observed steady structures. In this Letter, we examine the
emission measure distribution predicted for such a long nanoflare storm
by modeling an arcade of strands in an active region core. Comparisons
of the computed emission measure distributions with recent observations
indicate that the long nanoflare storm scenario implies greater than
five times more 1 MK emission than is actually observed for all
plausible combinations of loop lengths, heating rates, and abundances.
We conjecture that if the plasma had "super coronal" abundances, the
model may be able to match the observations at low temperatures.},

diffuse component of active regions is much less clear. Are these

spectacular new data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
telescopes on the Solar Dynamics Observatory offer an excellent
opportunity to address this question. We analyze the light curves of
coronal loops and the diffuse corona in six different AIA channels and
compare them with the predicted light curves from theoretical models.
Light curves in the different AIA channels reach their peak intensities
with predictable orderings as a function the nanoflare storm properties.
We show that while some sets of light curves exhibit clear evidence of
cooling after nanoflare storms, other cases are less straightforward to
interpret. Complications arise because of line-of-sight integration
through many different structures, the broadband nature of the AIA
channels, and because physical properties can change substantially
depending on the magnitude of the energy release. Nevertheless, the
light curves exhibit predictable and understandable patterns consistent

predictions of any proposed theory of heating. However, the nature of
the bulk downflows raises the possibility that enthalpy may play a key
role in the energy balance of the loops and in particular that it powers
the transition region radiation. In this Letter, we use one-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations of loop cooling to show that enthalpy losses
from the corona are easily sufficient to power the transition region
radiation. This contrasts with the long-held view that downward thermal
conduction powers the transition region. The traditional distinction
between the transition region and the corona in terms of temperature
alone is then a grossly unphysical simplification, and a proper
definition of the interface between these atmospheric layers requires a
detailed knowledge of their energy balance. To this end, we propose a
robust new definition of the transition region.},

We model the evolution of a bundle of strands heated by a storm of nanoflares by means of a hydrodynamic 0D loop model (EBTEL). The light curves obtained from a random combination of those of single strands are compared to the observed light curves either in a single pixel or in a row of pixels, simultaneously in the two channels, and using two independent methods: an artificial intelligent system (Probabilistic Neural Network) and a simple cross-correlation technique. We explore the space of the parameters to constrain the distribution of the heat pulses, their duration, their spatial size, and, as a feedback on the data, their signatures on the light curves. From both methods the best agreement is obtained for a relatively large population of events (1000) with a short duration (less than 1 minute) and a relatively shallow distribution (power law with index 1.5) in a limited energy range (1.5 decades). The feedback on the data indicates that bumps in the light curves, especially in the 94 \AA{} channel, are signatures of a heating excess that occurred a few minutes before.},

$\alpha$. Our conclusions are: (1) low-frequency nanoflare
heating is consistent with about 36\% of observed active region cores
when uncertainties in the atomic data are not accounted for; (2) proper
consideration of uncertainties yields a range in which as many as 77\% of
observed active regions are consistent with low-frequency nanoflare
heating and as few as zero; (3) low-frequency nanoflare heating cannot
explain observed slopes greater than 3; (4) the upper limit to the
volumetric energy release is in the region of 50 erg cm-3 to
avoid unphysical magnetic field strengths; (5) the heating timescale may
be short for loops of total length less than 40 Mm to be consistent with
the observed range of slopes; (6) predicted slopes are consistently
steeper for longer loops.},

analyzing the slope of the emission measure distribution coolward of the
peak. In a previous study we showed that low-frequency heating can
account for 0\% to 77\% of active region core emission measures. We now
turn our attention to heating by a finite succession of impulsive events
for which the timescale between events on a single magnetic strand is
shorter than the cooling timescale. We refer to this scenario as a
"nanoflare train" and explore a parameter space of heating and coronal
loop properties with a hydrodynamic model. Our conclusions are (1)
nanoflare trains are consistent with 86\% to 100\% of observed active
region cores when uncertainties in the atomic data are properly
accounted for; (2) steeper slopes are found for larger values of the
ratio of the train duration $\Delta$ H to the post-train
cooling and draining timescale $\Delta$ C , where $\Delta$
H depends on the number of heating events, the event duration and
the time interval between successive events ($\tau$ C ); (3)
$\tau$ C may be diagnosed from the width of the hot component
of the emission measure provided that the temperature bins are much
smaller than 0.1 dex (4) the slope of the emission measure alone is not

The moss is believed to be due to million-degree emission from the transition regions at the footpoints of coronal loops whose maximum temperatures are several million degrees. The two key results from the TRACE observations discussed in this paper are that in the moss regions one generally sees only moss, not
million-degree loops, and that the moss emission exhibits only weak intensity variations, \textasciitilde{}10\% over periods of hours. TRACE movies showing these results are presented. We demonstrate, using both analytic and numerical calculations, that the lack of observable million-degree loops in the moss regions places severe constraints on the possible time variability of coronal heating in the loops overlying the moss. In particular, the heating in the hot moss loops cannot be truly flarelike with a sharp cutoff, but instead must be quasi-steady to an excellent approximation. Furthermore, the lack of significant variations in the moss intensity implies that the heating magnitude is only weakly varying. The implications of these conclusions for coronal heating models will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Aims: To demonstrate the capabilities of regularized inversion to 
recover differential emission measures (DEMs) from multi-wavelength
observations provided by telescopes such as Hinode and SDO. 
Methods: We develop and apply an enhanced regularization algorithm, used
in RHESSI X-ray spectral analysis, to constrain the ill-posed inverse
problem that is determining the DEM from solar observations. We
demonstrate this computationally fast technique applied to a range of
DEM models simulating broadband imaging data from SDO/AIA and high
resolution line spectra from Hinode/EIS, as well as actual active region
observations with Hinode/EIS and XRT. As this regularization method
naturally provides both vertical and horizontal (temperature resolution)
error bars we are able to test the role of uncertainties in the data and
response functions. Results: The regularization method is able to
successfully recover the DEM from simulated data of a variety of model
DEMs (single Gaussian, multiple Gaussians and CHIANTI DEM models). It is
able to do this, at best, to over four orders of magnitude in DEM space
but typically over two orders of magnitude from peak emission. The
combination of horizontal and vertical error bars and the regularized
solution matrix allows us to easily determine the accuracy and
robustness of the regularized DEM. We find that the typical range for
the horizontal errors is $\Delta$log T $\approx$ 0.1-0.5 and this is dependent
on the observed signal to noise, uncertainty in the response functions
as well as the source model and temperature. With Hinode/EIS an
uncertainty of 20\% greatly broadens the regularized DEMs for both
Gaussian and CHIANTI models although information about the underlying
DEMs is still recoverable. When applied to real active region
observations with Hinode/EIS and XRT the regularization method is able
to recover a DEM similar to that found via a MCMC method but in
considerably less computational time. Conclusions: Regularized
inversion quickly determines the DEM from solar observations and
provides reliable error estimates (both horizontal and vertical) which
allows the temperature spread of coronal plasma to be robustly
quantified.},

  abstract = {The minimum-energy configuration for the magnetic field above the solar photosphere is curl-free (hence, by Amp\`ere's law, also
current-free), so can be represented as the gradient of a scalar potential. Since magnetic fields are divergence free, this scalar potential obeys Laplace's equation, given an appropriate boundary condition (BC). With measurements of the full magnetic vector at the photosphere, it is possible to employ either Neumann or Dirichlet BCs there. Historically, the Neumann BC was used with available
line-of-sight magnetic field measurements, which approximate the radial field needed for the Neumann BC. Since each BC fully determines the 3D vector magnetic field, either choice will, in general, be inconsistent with some aspect of the observed field on the boundary, due to the presence of both currents and noise in the observed field. We present a method to combine solutions from both Dirichlet and Neumann BCs to determine a hybrid, "least-squares" potential field, which minimizes the integrated square of the residual between the potential and actual fields. We also explore weighting the residuals in the fit by spatially uniform measurement uncertainties. This has advantages both in not overfitting the radial field used for the Neumann BC, and in maximizing consistency with the observations. We demonstrate our methods with SDO/HMI vector magnetic field observations of active region 11158, and find that residual discrepancies between the observed and potential fields are significant, and they are consistent with nonzero horizontal photospheric currents. We also analyze potential fields for two other active regions observed with two different vector magnetographs, and find that hybrid-potential fields have significantly less energy than the Neumann fields in every case - by more than 10\^\{32\} erg in some cases. This has major implications for estimates of free magnetic energy in coronal field models, e.g., non-linear force-free field
extrapolations.},

  abstract = {Observational and theoretical evidence suggests that coronal heating is impulsive and occurs on very small cross-field spatial scales. A single coronal loop could contain a hundred or more individual strands that are heated quasi-independently by nanoflares. It is therefore an enormous undertaking to model an entire active region or the global corona. Three-dimensional MHD codes have inadequate spatial resolution, and one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic codes are too slow to simulate the many thousands of elemental strands that must be treated in a reasonable representation. Fortunately, thermal conduction and flows tend to smooth out plasma gradients along the magnetic field, so zero-dimensional (0D) models are an acceptable alternative. We have developed a highly efficient model called ``enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops'' (EBTEL), which accurately describes the evolution of the average temperature, pressure, and density along a coronal strand. It improves significantly on earlier models of this type-in accuracy, flexibility, and capability. It treats both slowly varying and highly impulsive coronal heating; it provides the time-dependent differential emission measure distribution, DEM(T), at the transition region footpoints; and there are options for heat flux saturation and nonthermal electron beam heating. EBTEL gives excellent agreement with far more sophisticated 1D hydrodynamic simulations despite using 4 orders of magnitude less computing time. It promises to be a powerful new tool for solar and stellar studies.},

  abstract = {A well-known behavior of EUV light curves of discrete coronal loops is 
that the peak intensities of cooler channels or spectral lines are
reached at progressively later times than hotter channels. This time lag
is understood to be the result of hot coronal loop plasma cooling
through these lower respective temperatures. However, loops typically
comprise only a minority of the total emission in active regions (ARs).
Is this cooling pattern a common property of AR coronal plasma, or does
it only occur in unique circumstances, locations, and times? The new
Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) data
provide a wonderful opportunity to answer this question systematically
for an entire AR. We measure the time lag between pairs of SDO/AIA EUV
channels using 24 hr of images of AR 11082 observed on 2010 June 19. We
find that there is a time-lag signal consistent with cooling plasma,
just as is usually found for loops, throughout the AR including the
diffuse emission between loops for the entire 24 hr duration. The
pattern persists consistently for all channel pairs and choice of window
length within the 24 hr time period, giving us confidence that the
plasma is cooling from temperatures of greater than 3 MK, and sometimes
exceeding 7 MK, down to temperatures lower than \textasciitilde{}0.8 MK. This suggests
that the bulk of the emitting coronal plasma in this AR is not steady;
rather, it is dynamic and constantly evolving. These measurements
provide crucial constraints on any model which seeks to describe coronal
heating.},

differential emission measure (DEM). A significant variation of the
slope is found at different spatial locations within the active region.
We selected two regions that were not greatly affected by lower
temperature emission along the line of sight. We found that the EM had a
power law of the form EM $\propto$ Tb, with b = 4.4 $\pm$
0.4, and 4.6 $\pm$ 0.4, during the first and second appearance of the
active region, respectively. During the second rotation, line-of-sight
effects become more important, although difficult to estimate. We found
that the use of the ground calibration for Hinode/EIS and the
approximate method to derive the EM, used in previous publications,
produce an underestimation of the slopes. The EM distribution in active

heating, and does not change much during the evolution of the active

TN must then be of the order of hundreds to no more than a

build up the required magnetic energy is thus too long to account for

that nanoflare energies may be smaller than previously envisioned.},

test a simple steady heating model. First we calculate the differential
emission measure (DEM) of the apex region of the loops in the active
region core. We find the DEM to be broad and peaked around 3 MK. We then
determine the densities in the corresponding footpoint regions. Using
potential field extrapolations to approximate the loop lengths and the
density-sensitive line ratios to infer the magnitude of the heating, we
build a steady heating model for the active region core and find that we
can match the general properties of the observed DEM for the temperature
range of 6.3 $<$ log T $<$ 6.7. This model, for the first time,
accounts for the base pressure, loop length, and distribution of apex
temperatures of the core loops. We find that the density-sensitive
spectral line intensities and the bulk of the hot emission in the active
region core are consistent with steady heating. We also find, however,
that the steady heating model cannot address the emission observed at
lower temperatures. This emission may be due to foreground or background
structures, or may indicate that the heating in the core is more
complicated. Different heating scenarios must be tested to determine if
they have the same level of agreement.},

What differs is the average frequency of the distributions. The activity patterns are manifested in time lag maps of narrow-band instrument channel pairs. We combine hydrodynamic and forward modeling codes with a magnetic field extrapolation to create a model active region and apply the time lag method to synthetic
observations. Our aim is not to reproduce a particular set of
observations in detail, but to recover some typical properties and patterns observed in active regions. Our key findings are the following. (1) Cooling dominates the time lag signature and the time lags between the channel pairs are generally consistent with observed values. (2) Shorter coronal loops in the core cool more quickly than longer loops at the periphery. (3) All channel pairs show zero time lag when the line of sight passes through coronal loop footpoints. (4) There is strong evidence that plasma must be re-energized on a timescale comparable to the cooling timescale to reproduce the observed coronal activity, but it is likely that a relatively broad spectrum of heating frequencies are operating across active regions. (5) Due to their highly dynamic nature, we find nanoflare trains produce zero time lags along entire flux tubes in our model active region that are seen between the same channel pairs in observed active regions.},

SunPy is a data-analysis environment specializing in providing the software necessary to analyse solar and heliospheric data in Python. SunPy is open-source software (BSD licence) and has an open and transparent development workflow that anyone can contribute to. SunPy provides access to solar data through integration with the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO), the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), and the HELiophysics Integrated Observatory (HELIO) webservices. It
currently supports image data from major solar missions (e.g., SDO, SOHO, STEREO, and IRIS), time-series data from missions such as GOES, SDO/EVE, and PROBA2/LYRA, and radio spectra from e-Callisto and
STEREO/SWAVES. We describe SunPy's functionality, provide examples of solar data analysis in SunPy, and show how Python-based solar data-analysis can leverage the many existing tools already available in Python.

  abstract = {In this paper, we examine 15 different active regions (ARs) observed with the Solar Dynamics Observatory and analyze their nanoflare properties. We have recently developed a technique that systematically identifies and measures plasma temperature dynamics by computing time lags between light curves. The time lag method tests whether the plasma is maintained at a steady temperature, or if it is dynamic, undergoing heating and cooling cycles. An important aspect of our technique is that it analyzes both observationally distinct coronal loops as well as the much more prevalent diffuse emission between them. We find that the widespread cooling reported previously for NOAA AR 11082 is a generic property of all ARs. The results are consistent with impulsive nanoflare heating followed by slower cooling. Only occasionally, however, is there full cooling from above 7 MK to well below 1 MK. More often, the plasma cools to approximately 1\textendash{}2 MK before being reheated by another nanoflare. These same 15 ARs were first studied by Warren et al. We find that the degree of cooling is not well correlated with the reported slopes of the emission measure distribution. We also conclude that the Fe xviii emitting plasma that they measured is mostly in a state of cooling. These results support the idea that nanoflares have a distribution of energies and frequencies, with the average delay between successive events on an individual flux tube being comparable to the plasma cooling timescale.},

@misc{waskom_seaborn_2018,
  title = {Seaborn: V0.9.0},
  shorttitle = {Mwaskom/{{Seaborn}}},
  abstract = {v0.9.0 (July 2018)
Note: a version of these release notes with working links appears in the online documentation.
This is a major release with several substantial and long-desired new features. There are also updates/modifications to the themes and color palettes that give better consistency with matplotlib 2.0 and some notable API changes.
New relational plots
Three completely new plotting functions have been added: catplot, scatterplot, and lineplot. The first is a figure-level interface to the latter two that combines them with a FacetGrid. The functions bring the high-level, dataset-oriented API of the seaborn categorical plotting functions to more general plots (scatter plots and line plots).
These functions can visualize a relationship between two numeric variables while mapping up to three additional variables by modifying $<$code$>$hue$<$/code$>$, $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$, and/or $<$code$>$style$<$/code$>$ semantics. The common high-level API is implemented differently in the two functions. For example, the size semantic in scatterplot scales the area of scatter plot points, but in lineplot it scales width of the line plot lines. The API is dataset-oriented, meaning that in both cases you pass the variable in your dataset rather than directly specifying the matplotlib parameters to use for point area or line width.
Another way the relational functions differ from existing seaborn functionality is that they have better support for using numeric variables for $<$code$>$hue$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$ semantics. This functionality may be propagated to other functions that can add a $<$code$>$hue$<$/code$>$ semantic in future versions; it has not been in this release.
The lineplot function also has support for statistical estimation and is replacing the older $<$code$>$tsplot$<$/code$>$ function, which still exists but is marked for removal in a future release. lineplot is better aligned with the API of the rest of the library and more flexible in showing relationships across additional variables by modifying the size and style semantics independently. It also has substantially improved support for date and time data, a major pain factor in $<$code$>$tsplot$<$/code$>$. The cost is that some of the more esoteric options in $<$code$>$tsplot$<$/code$>$ for representing uncertainty (e.g. a colormapped KDE of the bootstrap distribution) have not been implemented in the new function.
There is quite a bit of new documentation that explains these new functions in more detail, including detailed examples of the various options in the API reference and a more verbose tutorial.
These functions should be considered in a "stable beta" state. They have been thoroughly tested, but some unknown corner cases may remain to be found. The main features are in place, but not all planned functionality has been implemented. There are planned improvements to some elements, particularly the default legend, that are a little rough around the edges in this release. Finally, some of the default behavior (e.g. the default range of point/line sizes) may change somewhat in future releases.
Updates to themes and palettes
Several changes have been made to the seaborn style themes, context scaling, and color palettes. In general the aim of these changes was to make the seaborn styles more consistent with the style updates in matplotlib 2.0 and to leverage some of the new style parameters for better implementation of some aspects of the seaborn styles. Here is a list of the changes:

Reorganized and updated some axes\_style/plotting\_context parameters to take advantage of improvements in the matplotlib 2.0 update. The biggest change involves using several new parameterss in the "style" spec while moving parameters that used to implement the corresponding aesthetics to the "context" spec. For example, axes spines and ticks are now off instead of having their width/length zeroed out for the darkgrid style. That means the width/length of these elements can now be scaled in different contexts. The effect is a more cohesive appearance of the plots, especially in larger contexts. These changes include only minimal support for the 1.x matplotlib series. Users who are stuck on matplotlib 1.5 but wish to use seaborn styling may want to use the seaborn parameters that can be accessed through the matplotlib stylesheet interface.
Updated the seaborn palettes ("deep", "muted", "colorblind", etc.) to correspond with the new 10-color matplotlib default. The legacy palettes are now available at "deep6", "muted6", "colorblind6", etc. Additionally, a few individual colors were tweaked for better consistency, aesthetics, and accessibility.
Calling color\_palette (or set\_palette) with a named qualitative palettes (i.e. one of the seaborn palettes, the colorbrewer qualitative palettes, or the matplotlib matplotlib tableau-derived palettes) and no specified number of colors will return all of the colors in the palette. This means that for some palettes, the returned list will have a different length than it did in previous versions.
Enhanced color\_palette to accept a parameterized specification of a cubehelix palette in in a string, prefixed with $<$code$>$"ch:"$<$/code$>$ (e.g. $<$code$>$"ch:-.1,.2,l=.7"$<$/code$>$). Note that keyword arguments can be spelled out or referenced using only their first letter. Reversing the palette is accomplished by appending $<$code$>$"\_r"$<$/code$>$, as with other matplotlib colormaps. This specification will be accepted by any seaborn function with a $<$code$>$palette=$<$/code$>$ parameter.
Slightly increased the base font sizes in plotting\_context and increased the scaling factors for $<$code$>$"talk"$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$"poster"$<$/code$>$ contexts.
Calling set will now call set\_color\_codes to re-assign the single letter color codes by default

API changes
A few functions have been renamed or have had changes to their default parameters.

The $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ function has been renamed to catplot. The new name ditches the original R-inflected terminology to use a name that is more consistent with terminology in pandas and in seaborn itself. This change should hopefully make catplot easier to discover, and it should make more clear what its role is. $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ still exists and will pass its arguments through to catplot with a warning. It may be removed eventually, but the transition will be as gradual as possible.
The other reason that the $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ name was changed was to ease another alteration which is that the default $<$code$>$kind$<$/code$>$ in catplot is now $<$code$>$"strip"$<$/code$>$ (corresponding to stripplot). This plots a categorical scatter plot which is usually a much better place to start and is more consistent with the default in relplot. The old default style in $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ ($<$code$>$"point"$<$/code$>$, corresponding to pointplot) remains available if you want to show a statistical estimation.
The $<$code$>$lvplot$<$/code$>$ function has been renamed to boxenplot. The "letter-value" terminology that was used to name the original kind of plot is obscure, and the abbreviation to $<$code$>$lv$<$/code$>$ did not help anything. The new name should make the plot more discoverable by describing its format (it plots multiple boxes, also known as "boxen"). As with $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$, the $<$code$>$lvplot$<$/code$>$ function still exists to provide a relatively smooth transition.
Renamed the $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$ parameter to $<$code$>$height$<$/code$>$ in multi-plot grid objects (FacetGrid, PairGrid, and JointGrid) along with functions that use them ($<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$, lmplot, pairplot, and jointplot) to avoid conflicts with the $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$ parameter that is used in $<$code$>$scatterplot$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$lineplot$<$/code$>$ (necessary to make relplot work) and also makes the meaning of the parameter a bit more clear.
Changed the default diagonal plots in pairplot to use `func`:kdeplot` when a $<$code$>$"hue"$<$/code$>$ dimension is used.
Deprecated the statistical annotation component of JointGrid. The method is still available but will be removed in a future version.
Two older functions that were deprecated in earlier versions, $<$code$>$coefplot$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$interactplot$<$/code$>$, have undergone final removal from the code base.

Documentation improvements
There has been some effort put into improving the documentation. The biggest change is that the introduction to the library has been completely rewritten to provide much more information and, critically, examples. In addition to the high-level motivation, the introduction also covers some important topics that are often sources of confusion, like the distinction between figure-level and axes-level functions, how datasets should be formatted for use in seaborn, and how to customize the appearance of the plots.
Other improvements have been made throughout, most notably a thorough re-write of the categorical tutorial categorical\_tutorial.
Other small enhancements and bug fixes

Changed rugplot to plot a matplotlib $<$code$>$LineCollection$<$/code$>$ instead of many $<$code$>$Line2D$<$/code$>$ objects, providing a big speedup for large arrays.
Changed the default off-diagonal plots to use scatterplot. (Note that the $<$code$>$"hue"$<$/code$>$ currently draws three separate scatterplots instead of using the hue semantic of the scatterplot function).
Changed color handling when using kdeplot with two variables. The default colormap for the 2D density now follows the color cycle, and the function can use $<$code$>$color$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$label$<$/code$>$ kwargs, adding more flexibility and avoiding a warning when using with multi-plot grids.
Added the $<$code$>$subplot\_kws$<$/code$>$ parameter to PairGrid for more flexibility.
Removed a special case in PairGrid that defaulted to drawing stacked histograms on the diagonal axes.
Fixed jointplot/JointGrid and regplot so that they now accept list inputs.
Fixed a bug in FacetGrid when using a single row/column level or using $<$code$>$col\_wrap=1$<$/code$>$.
Fixed functions that set axis limits so that they preserve auto-scaling state on matplotlib 2.0.
Avoided an error when using matplotlib backends that cannot render a canvas (e.g. PDF).
Changed the install infrastructure to explicitly declare dependencies in a way that $<$code$>$pip$<$/code$>$ is aware of. This means that $<$code$>$pip install seaborn$<$/code$>$ will now work in an empty environment. Additionally, the dependencies are specified with strict minimal versions.
Updated the testing infrastructure to execute tests with pytest (although many individual tests still use nose assertion).},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large.

Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\textendash{}156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

  abstract = {Much evidence suggests that the solar corona is heated impulsively, meaning that nanoflares may be ubiquitous in quiet and active regions (ARs). Hard X-ray (HXR) observations with unprecedented sensitivity \&gt;3 keV are now enabled by focusing instruments. We analyzed data from the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) rocket and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) spacecraft to constrain properties of AR nanoflares simulated by the EBTEL field-line-averaged hydrodynamics code. We generated model X-ray spectra by computing differential emission measures for homogeneous nanoflare sequences with heating amplitudes H \textsubscript{0}, durations $\tau$, delay times between events t \textsubscript{ N }, and filling factors f. The single quiescent AR observed by FOXSI-2 on 2014 December 11 is well fit by nanoflare sequences with heating amplitudes 0.02 erg cm\textsuperscript{-3} s\textsuperscript{-1} \&lt;H \textsubscript{0} \&lt; 13 erg cm\textsuperscript{-3} s\textsuperscript{-1} and a wide range of delay times and durations. We exclude delays between events shorter than $\sim$900 s at the 90\% confidence level for this region. Three of five regions observed by NuSTAR on 2014 November 1 are well fit by homogeneous nanoflare models, while two regions with higher fluxes are not. Generally, the NuSTAR count spectra are well fit by nanoflare sequences with smaller heating amplitudes, shorter delays, and shorter durations than the allowed FOXSI-2 models. These apparent discrepancies are likely due to differences in spectral coverage between the two instruments and intrinsic differences among the regions. Steady heating (t \textsubscript{ N } = $\tau$) was ruled out with \&gt;99\% confidence for all regions observed by either instrument.},

The methods by which the emission measure as a function of temperature can be interpreted are discussed. The models of density and temperature which can be made from a variety of combinations of the emission measure with information on the spatial distribution of material are broadly consistent. They show that the plasma at low heights over the central parts of an active region is hotter and denser than that which extends to greater heights. It appears that much of the emitting material exists in the form of loop structures, presumably magnetically controlled flux tubes. Analytical relationships between the physically important parameters describing the properties of the active region at T\textsubscript{e} greater than 200,000 K are developed and discussed.},

representative loop structures that brighten and fade first from X-ray images and subsequently from the EUV images. We determine their lifetime and the delay between their appearance in the different filters. We find that the lifetime in the EUV filters is much longer than expected for a single cooling loop. We also notice that the delay in the loops' appearance in the X-ray and EUV filters is proportional to the loop length. We model one of the loops using a hydrodynamic model with both impulsive and quasi-steady heating functions and find that neither of these simple heating functions can well reproduce the observed loop characteristics in both the X-ray and EUV images. Hence, although this active region is dominated by variable emission and the characteristics of the observed loops are qualitatively consistent with a cooling loop, the timescale of the heating in this active region remains unknown.},

The intensity of these loops implies a density that is as much as 3 orders of magnitude larger than the densities of static solutions to the hydrodynamic equations. It has recently been suggested that these loops are bundles of impulsively heated strands that are cooling through the TRACE passbands. This scenario implies that the loops would appear in the hotter (Fe XV 284 \AA{} or Fe XII 195 \AA{}) TRACE filter images before appearing in the cooler (Fe IX/X 171 \AA{}) TRACE filter images. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by examining the temporal evolution of five active region loops in multiple TRACE EUV filter images. We find that all the loops appear in the hotter filter images before appearing in cooler filter images. We then use the measured delay to estimate a cooling time and find that four of the five loops have lifetimes greater than the expected lifetime of a cooling loop. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that each apparent loop is a bundle of sequentially heated strands; other explanations will also be discussed. To facilitate comparisons between these loops and hydrodynamic simulations, we use a new technique to estimate the loop length and geometry.},

After commissioning, HMI began normal operations on 1 May 2010 and has subsequently observed the Sun's entire visible disk almost continuously. HMI collects sequences of polarized filtergrams taken at a fixed cadence with two 4096 \texttimes{} 4096 cameras, from which are computed arcsecond-resolution maps of photospheric observables that include line-of-sight velocity and magnetic field, continuum intensity, line width, line depth, and the Stokes polarization parameters [I, Q, U, V]. Two processing pipelines have been implemented at the SDO Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC) at Stanford University to compute these observables from calibrated Level-1 filtergrams, one that computes line-of-sight quantities every 45 seconds and the other, primarily for the vector magnetic field, that computes averages on a 720-second cadence. Corrections are made for static and temporally changing CCD characteristics, bad pixels, image alignment and distortion, polarization irregularities, filter-element uncertainty and nonuniformity, as well as Sun-spacecraft velocity. We detail the functioning of these two pipelines, explain known issues affecting the measurements of the resulting physical quantities, and describe how regular updates to the instrument calibration impact them. We also describe how the scheme for computing the observables is optimized for actual HMI observations. Initial calibration of HMI was performed on the ground using a variety of light sources and calibration sequences. During the five years of the SDO prime mission, regular calibration sequences have been taken on orbit to improve and regularly update the instrument calibration, and to monitor changes in the HMI instrument. This has resulted in several changes in the observables processing that are detailed here. The instrument more than satisfies all of the original specifications for data quality and continuity. The procedures described here still have significant room for improvement. The most significant remaining systematic errors are associated with the spacecraft orbital velocity.},

Usually, solar active regions that produce large flares will also produce a CME, but this is not always true. Despite advances in numerical modeling, it is still unclear which circumstances will produce a CME. Therefore, it is worthwhile to empirically determine which features distinguish flares associated with CMEs from flares that are not. At this time, no
extensive study has used physically meaningful features of active regions to distinguish between these two populations. As such, we attempt to do so by using features derived from (1) photospheric vector magnetic field data taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory's
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instrument and (2) X-ray flux data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite's X-ray Flux instrument. We build a catalog of active regions that either produced both a flare and a CME (the positive class) or simply a flare (the negative class). We then use machine-learning algorithms to (1)
determine which features distinguish these two populations, and (2) forecast whether an active region that produces an M- or X-class flare will also produce a CME. We compute the True Skill Statistic, a forecast verification metric, and find that it is a relatively high value of $\sim$0.8 $\pm$ 0.2. We conclude that a combination of six parameters,
which are all intensive in nature, will capture most of the relevant information contained in the photospheric magnetic field.},

constraining the coronal heating mechanism. Observations of "warm"
coronal loops (\textasciitilde{}1 MK) have indicated that the heating is impulsive and
that coronal plasma is far from equilibrium. In contrast, observations
at higher temperatures (\textasciitilde{}3 MK) have generally been consistent with
steady heating models. Previous observations, however, have not been
able to exclude the possibility that the high temperature loops are
actually composed of many small-scale threads that are in various stages
of heating and cooling and only appear to be in equilibrium. With new
observations from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer and X-ray Telescope (XRT)
on Hinode we have the ability to investigate the properties of high
temperature coronal plasma in extraordinary detail. We examine the
emission in the core of an active region and find three independent
lines of evidence for steady heating. We find that the emission observed
in XRT is generally steady for hours, with a fluctuation level of
approximately 15\% in an individual pixel. Short-lived impulsive heating
events are observed, but they appear to be unrelated to the steady
emission that dominates the active region. Furthermore, we find no
evidence for warm emission that is spatially correlated with the hot
emission, as would be expected if the high temperature loops are the
result of impulsive heating. Finally, we also find that intensities in
the "moss," the footpoints of high temperature loops, are consistent
with steady heating models provided that we account for the local
expansion of the loop from the base of the transition region to the
corona. In combination, these results provide strong evidence that the
heating in the core of an active region is effectively steady, that is,
the time between heating events is short relative to the relevant
radiative and conductive cooling times.},

\AA{} line. Using the 2'' slit, we repeatedly scanned 150'' by 150''
in a few minutes. This is the first time it has been possible to make
such velocity measurements in the moss, and the data presented are the
highest cadence spatially resolved maps of moss Doppler and nonthermal
velocities ever obtained in the corona. The observed region produced
numerous C- and M-class flares with several occurring in the core close
to the moss. The magnetic field was therefore clearly changing in the
active region core, so we ought to be able to detect dynamic signatures
in the moss if they exist. Our measurements of moss intensities agree
with previous studies in that a less than 15\% variability is seen over a
period of 16 hr. Our new measurements of Doppler and nonthermal
velocities reveal no strong flows or motions in the moss, nor any
significant variability in these quantities. The results confirm that
moss at the bases of high temperature coronal loops is heated
quasi-steadily. They also show that quasi-steady heating can contribute
significantly even in the core of a flare productive active region. Such
heating may be impulsive at high frequency, but if so it does not give
rise to large flows or motions.},
