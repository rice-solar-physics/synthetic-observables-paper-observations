  abstract = {The recent analysis of observations taken with the EUV Imaging Spectrometer and X-Ray Telescope instruments on Hinode suggests that well-constrained measurements of the temperature distribution in solar active regions can finally be made. Such measurements are critical for constraining theories of coronal heating. Past analysis, however, has suffered from limited sample sizes and large uncertainties at temperatures between 5 and 10~MK. Here we present a systematic study of the differential emission measure distribution in 15 active region cores. We focus on measurements in the inter-moss region, that is, the region between the loop footpoints, where the observations are easier to interpret. To reduce the uncertainties at the highest temperatures we present a new method for isolating the Fe XVIII emission in the AIA/SDO 94 \AA{} channel. The resulting differential emission measure distributions confirm our previous analysis showing that the temperature distribution in an active region core is often strongly peaked near 4~MK. We characterize the properties of the emission distribution as a function of the total unsigned magnetic flux. We find that the amount of high-temperature emission in the active region core is correlated with the total unsigned magnetic flux, while the emission at lower temperatures, in contrast, is inversely related. These results provide compelling evidence that high-temperature active region emission is often close to equilibrium, although weaker active regions may be dominated by evolving million degree loops in the core.},

  abstract = {The coronal heating mechanism for active region core loops is difficult to determine because these loops are often not resolved and cannot be studied individually. Rather, we concentrate on the "inter-moss" areas between loop footpoints. We use observations from the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer and the X-Ray Telescope to calculate the emission measure distributions of eight inter-moss areas in five different active regions. The combined data sets provide both high- and low-temperature constraints and ensure complete coverage in the temperature range appropriate for active regions. For AR 11113, the emission can be modeled with heating events that occur on timescales less than the cooling time. The loops in the core regions appear to be close to equilibrium and are consistent with steady heating. The other regions studied, however, appear to be dominated by nanoflare heating. Our results are consistent with the idea that active region age is an important parameter in determining whether steady or nanoflare heating is primarily responsible for the core emission, that is, older regions are more likely to be dominated by steady heating, while younger regions show more evidence of nanoflares.},

solar active region using instruments on Hinode and the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO). These multi-instrument observations allow us to
determine the distribution of plasma temperatures and follow the
evolution of emission at different temperatures. We find that at the
apex of the high-temperature loops the emission measure distribution is
strongly peaked near 4 MK and falls off sharply at both higher and lower
temperatures. Perhaps most significantly, the emission measure at 0.5 MK
is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude from the peak at 4 MK.
We also find that the temporal evolution in broadband soft X-ray images
is relatively constant over about 6 hr of observing. Observations in the
cooler SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) bandpasses generally do
not show cooling loops in the core of the active region, consistent with
the steady emission observed at high temperatures. These observations
suggest that the high-temperature loops observed in the core of an
active region are close to equilibrium. We find that it is possible to
reproduce the relative intensities of high-temperature emission lines
with a simple, high-frequency heating scenario where heating events
occur on timescales much less than a characteristic cooling time. In
contrast, low-frequency heating scenarios, which are commonly invoked to
describe nanoflare models of coronal heating, do not reproduce the
relative intensities of high-temperature emission lines and predict
low-temperature emission that is approximately an order of magnitude too
large. We also present an initial look at images from the SDO/AIA 94

The intensities and velocities measured in the cores of quiescent active

heating scenario that has been proposed to reconcile such observations
with impulsive heating models is the "long nanoflare storm," where
short-duration heating events occur infrequently on many sub-resolution
strands; the emission of the strands is then averaged together to
explain the observed steady structures. In this Letter, we examine the
emission measure distribution predicted for such a long nanoflare storm
by modeling an arcade of strands in an active region core. Comparisons
of the computed emission measure distributions with recent observations
indicate that the long nanoflare storm scenario implies greater than
five times more 1 MK emission than is actually observed for all
plausible combinations of loop lengths, heating rates, and abundances.
We conjecture that if the plasma had "super coronal" abundances, the
model may be able to match the observations at low temperatures.},

relatively large amount of warm plasma, suggesting that the hot active

here. We explore a parameter space of heating and coronal loop

the slope $\alpha$ of the emission measure distribution EM(T)vpropT

heating is consistent with about 36\% of observed active region cores

consideration of uncertainties yields a range in which as many as 77\% of
observed active regions are consistent with low-frequency nanoflare
heating and as few as zero; (3) low-frequency nanoflare heating cannot
explain observed slopes greater than 3; (4) the upper limit to the
volumetric energy release is in the region of 50 erg cm-3 to

  abstract = {Aims: To demonstrate the capabilities of regularized inversion to 
recover differential emission measures (DEMs) from multi-wavelength
observations provided by telescopes such as Hinode and SDO. 
Methods: We develop and apply an enhanced regularization algorithm, used
in RHESSI X-ray spectral analysis, to constrain the ill-posed inverse
problem that is determining the DEM from solar observations. We
demonstrate this computationally fast technique applied to a range of
DEM models simulating broadband imaging data from SDO/AIA and high
resolution line spectra from Hinode/EIS, as well as actual active region
observations with Hinode/EIS and XRT. As this regularization method
naturally provides both vertical and horizontal (temperature resolution)
error bars we are able to test the role of uncertainties in the data and
response functions. Results: The regularization method is able to
successfully recover the DEM from simulated data of a variety of model
DEMs (single Gaussian, multiple Gaussians and CHIANTI DEM models). It is
able to do this, at best, to over four orders of magnitude in DEM space
but typically over two orders of magnitude from peak emission. The
combination of horizontal and vertical error bars and the regularized
solution matrix allows us to easily determine the accuracy and
robustness of the regularized DEM. We find that the typical range for
the horizontal errors is $\Delta$log T $\approx$ 0.1-0.5 and this is dependent
on the observed signal to noise, uncertainty in the response functions
as well as the source model and temperature. With Hinode/EIS an
uncertainty of 20\% greatly broadens the regularized DEMs for both
Gaussian and CHIANTI models although information about the underlying
DEMs is still recoverable. When applied to real active region
observations with Hinode/EIS and XRT the regularization method is able
to recover a DEM similar to that found via a MCMC method but in
considerably less computational time. Conclusions: Regularized
inversion quickly determines the DEM from solar observations and
provides reliable error estimates (both horizontal and vertical) which
allows the temperature spread of coronal plasma to be robustly
quantified.},

  abstract = {The minimum-energy configuration for the magnetic field above the solar photosphere is curl-free (hence, by Amp\`ere's law, also
current-free), so can be represented as the gradient of a scalar potential. Since magnetic fields are divergence free, this scalar potential obeys Laplace's equation, given an appropriate boundary condition (BC). With measurements of the full magnetic vector at the photosphere, it is possible to employ either Neumann or Dirichlet BCs there. Historically, the Neumann BC was used with available
line-of-sight magnetic field measurements, which approximate the radial field needed for the Neumann BC. Since each BC fully determines the 3D vector magnetic field, either choice will, in general, be inconsistent with some aspect of the observed field on the boundary, due to the presence of both currents and noise in the observed field. We present a method to combine solutions from both Dirichlet and Neumann BCs to determine a hybrid, "least-squares" potential field, which minimizes the integrated square of the residual between the potential and actual fields. We also explore weighting the residuals in the fit by spatially uniform measurement uncertainties. This has advantages both in not overfitting the radial field used for the Neumann BC, and in maximizing consistency with the observations. We demonstrate our methods with SDO/HMI vector magnetic field observations of active region 11158, and find that residual discrepancies between the observed and potential fields are significant, and they are consistent with nonzero horizontal photospheric currents. We also analyze potential fields for two other active regions observed with two different vector magnetographs, and find that hybrid-potential fields have significantly less energy than the Neumann fields in every case - by more than 10\^\{32\} erg in some cases. This has major implications for estimates of free magnetic energy in coronal field models, e.g., non-linear force-free field
extrapolations.},

that the peak intensities of cooler channels or spectral lines are
reached at progressively later times than hotter channels. This time lag
is understood to be the result of hot coronal loop plasma cooling

comprise only a minority of the total emission in active regions (ARs).
Is this cooling pattern a common property of AR coronal plasma, or does
it only occur in unique circumstances, locations, and times? The new
Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) data
provide a wonderful opportunity to answer this question systematically
for an entire AR. We measure the time lag between pairs of SDO/AIA EUV
channels using 24 hr of images of AR 11082 observed on 2010 June 19. We
find that there is a time-lag signal consistent with cooling plasma,
just as is usually found for loops, throughout the AR including the
diffuse emission between loops for the entire 24 hr duration. The
pattern persists consistently for all channel pairs and choice of window
length within the 24 hr time period, giving us confidence that the
plasma is cooling from temperatures of greater than 3 MK, and sometimes
exceeding 7 MK, down to temperatures lower than \textasciitilde{}0.8 MK. This suggests
that the bulk of the emitting coronal plasma in this AR is not steady;
rather, it is dynamic and constantly evolving. These measurements
provide crucial constraints on any model which seeks to describe coronal

slope is found at different spatial locations within the active region.
We selected two regions that were not greatly affected by lower
temperature emission along the line of sight. We found that the EM had a
power law of the form EM $\propto$ Tb, with b = 4.4 $\pm$
0.4, and 4.6 $\pm$ 0.4, during the first and second appearance of the
active region, respectively. During the second rotation, line-of-sight
effects become more important, although difficult to estimate. We found

produce an underestimation of the slopes. The EM distribution in active

heating, and does not change much during the evolution of the active

the relaxation from one stressed coronal state to another, dissipating
only a small fraction of the available magnetic energy. A consequence is
that nanoflare energies may be smaller than previously envisioned.},

  abstract = {The frequency of heating events in the corona is an important constraint 
on the coronal heating mechanisms. Observations indicate that the
intensities and velocities measured in active region cores are
effectively steady, suggesting that heating events occur rapidly enough
to keep high-temperature active region loops close to equilibrium. In
this paper, we couple observations of active region (AR) 10955 made with
the X-Ray Telescope and the EUV Imaging Spectrometer on board Hinode to
test a simple steady heating model. First we calculate the differential
emission measure (DEM) of the apex region of the loops in the active
region core. We find the DEM to be broad and peaked around 3 MK. We then
determine the densities in the corresponding footpoint regions. Using
potential field extrapolations to approximate the loop lengths and the
density-sensitive line ratios to infer the magnitude of the heating, we
build a steady heating model for the active region core and find that we
can match the general properties of the observed DEM for the temperature
range of 6.3 $<$ log T $<$ 6.7. This model, for the first time,
accounts for the base pressure, loop length, and distribution of apex
temperatures of the core loops. We find that the density-sensitive
spectral line intensities and the bulk of the hot emission in the active
region core are consistent with steady heating. We also find, however,
that the steady heating model cannot address the emission observed at
lower temperatures. This emission may be due to foreground or background
structures, or may indicate that the heating in the core is more
complicated. Different heating scenarios must be tested to determine if
they have the same level of agreement.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we examine 15 different active regions (ARs) observed with the Solar Dynamics Observatory and analyze their nanoflare properties. We have recently developed a technique that systematically identifies and measures plasma temperature dynamics by computing time lags between light curves. The time lag method tests whether the plasma is maintained at a steady temperature, or if it is dynamic, undergoing heating and cooling cycles. An important aspect of our technique is that it analyzes both observationally distinct coronal loops as well as the much more prevalent diffuse emission between them. We find that the widespread cooling reported previously for NOAA AR 11082 is a generic property of all ARs. The results are consistent with impulsive nanoflare heating followed by slower cooling. Only occasionally, however, is there full cooling from above 7 MK to well below 1 MK. More often, the plasma cools to approximately 1\textendash{}2 MK before being reheated by another nanoflare. These same 15 ARs were first studied by Warren et al. We find that the degree of cooling is not well correlated with the reported slopes of the emission measure distribution. We also conclude that the Fe xviii emitting plasma that they measured is mostly in a state of cooling. These results support the idea that nanoflares have a distribution of energies and frequencies, with the average delay between successive events on an individual flux tube being comparable to the plasma cooling timescale.},

@misc{waskom_seaborn_2018,
  title = {Seaborn: V0.9.0},
  shorttitle = {Mwaskom/{{Seaborn}}},
  abstract = {v0.9.0 (July 2018)
Note: a version of these release notes with working links appears in the online documentation.
This is a major release with several substantial and long-desired new features. There are also updates/modifications to the themes and color palettes that give better consistency with matplotlib 2.0 and some notable API changes.
New relational plots
Three completely new plotting functions have been added: catplot, scatterplot, and lineplot. The first is a figure-level interface to the latter two that combines them with a FacetGrid. The functions bring the high-level, dataset-oriented API of the seaborn categorical plotting functions to more general plots (scatter plots and line plots).
These functions can visualize a relationship between two numeric variables while mapping up to three additional variables by modifying $<$code$>$hue$<$/code$>$, $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$, and/or $<$code$>$style$<$/code$>$ semantics. The common high-level API is implemented differently in the two functions. For example, the size semantic in scatterplot scales the area of scatter plot points, but in lineplot it scales width of the line plot lines. The API is dataset-oriented, meaning that in both cases you pass the variable in your dataset rather than directly specifying the matplotlib parameters to use for point area or line width.
Another way the relational functions differ from existing seaborn functionality is that they have better support for using numeric variables for $<$code$>$hue$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$ semantics. This functionality may be propagated to other functions that can add a $<$code$>$hue$<$/code$>$ semantic in future versions; it has not been in this release.
The lineplot function also has support for statistical estimation and is replacing the older $<$code$>$tsplot$<$/code$>$ function, which still exists but is marked for removal in a future release. lineplot is better aligned with the API of the rest of the library and more flexible in showing relationships across additional variables by modifying the size and style semantics independently. It also has substantially improved support for date and time data, a major pain factor in $<$code$>$tsplot$<$/code$>$. The cost is that some of the more esoteric options in $<$code$>$tsplot$<$/code$>$ for representing uncertainty (e.g. a colormapped KDE of the bootstrap distribution) have not been implemented in the new function.
There is quite a bit of new documentation that explains these new functions in more detail, including detailed examples of the various options in the API reference and a more verbose tutorial.
These functions should be considered in a "stable beta" state. They have been thoroughly tested, but some unknown corner cases may remain to be found. The main features are in place, but not all planned functionality has been implemented. There are planned improvements to some elements, particularly the default legend, that are a little rough around the edges in this release. Finally, some of the default behavior (e.g. the default range of point/line sizes) may change somewhat in future releases.
Updates to themes and palettes
Several changes have been made to the seaborn style themes, context scaling, and color palettes. In general the aim of these changes was to make the seaborn styles more consistent with the style updates in matplotlib 2.0 and to leverage some of the new style parameters for better implementation of some aspects of the seaborn styles. Here is a list of the changes:

Reorganized and updated some axes\_style/plotting\_context parameters to take advantage of improvements in the matplotlib 2.0 update. The biggest change involves using several new parameterss in the "style" spec while moving parameters that used to implement the corresponding aesthetics to the "context" spec. For example, axes spines and ticks are now off instead of having their width/length zeroed out for the darkgrid style. That means the width/length of these elements can now be scaled in different contexts. The effect is a more cohesive appearance of the plots, especially in larger contexts. These changes include only minimal support for the 1.x matplotlib series. Users who are stuck on matplotlib 1.5 but wish to use seaborn styling may want to use the seaborn parameters that can be accessed through the matplotlib stylesheet interface.
Updated the seaborn palettes ("deep", "muted", "colorblind", etc.) to correspond with the new 10-color matplotlib default. The legacy palettes are now available at "deep6", "muted6", "colorblind6", etc. Additionally, a few individual colors were tweaked for better consistency, aesthetics, and accessibility.
Calling color\_palette (or set\_palette) with a named qualitative palettes (i.e. one of the seaborn palettes, the colorbrewer qualitative palettes, or the matplotlib matplotlib tableau-derived palettes) and no specified number of colors will return all of the colors in the palette. This means that for some palettes, the returned list will have a different length than it did in previous versions.
Enhanced color\_palette to accept a parameterized specification of a cubehelix palette in in a string, prefixed with $<$code$>$"ch:"$<$/code$>$ (e.g. $<$code$>$"ch:-.1,.2,l=.7"$<$/code$>$). Note that keyword arguments can be spelled out or referenced using only their first letter. Reversing the palette is accomplished by appending $<$code$>$"\_r"$<$/code$>$, as with other matplotlib colormaps. This specification will be accepted by any seaborn function with a $<$code$>$palette=$<$/code$>$ parameter.
Slightly increased the base font sizes in plotting\_context and increased the scaling factors for $<$code$>$"talk"$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$"poster"$<$/code$>$ contexts.
Calling set will now call set\_color\_codes to re-assign the single letter color codes by default

API changes
A few functions have been renamed or have had changes to their default parameters.

The $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ function has been renamed to catplot. The new name ditches the original R-inflected terminology to use a name that is more consistent with terminology in pandas and in seaborn itself. This change should hopefully make catplot easier to discover, and it should make more clear what its role is. $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ still exists and will pass its arguments through to catplot with a warning. It may be removed eventually, but the transition will be as gradual as possible.
The other reason that the $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ name was changed was to ease another alteration which is that the default $<$code$>$kind$<$/code$>$ in catplot is now $<$code$>$"strip"$<$/code$>$ (corresponding to stripplot). This plots a categorical scatter plot which is usually a much better place to start and is more consistent with the default in relplot. The old default style in $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ ($<$code$>$"point"$<$/code$>$, corresponding to pointplot) remains available if you want to show a statistical estimation.
The $<$code$>$lvplot$<$/code$>$ function has been renamed to boxenplot. The "letter-value" terminology that was used to name the original kind of plot is obscure, and the abbreviation to $<$code$>$lv$<$/code$>$ did not help anything. The new name should make the plot more discoverable by describing its format (it plots multiple boxes, also known as "boxen"). As with $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$, the $<$code$>$lvplot$<$/code$>$ function still exists to provide a relatively smooth transition.
Renamed the $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$ parameter to $<$code$>$height$<$/code$>$ in multi-plot grid objects (FacetGrid, PairGrid, and JointGrid) along with functions that use them ($<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$, lmplot, pairplot, and jointplot) to avoid conflicts with the $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$ parameter that is used in $<$code$>$scatterplot$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$lineplot$<$/code$>$ (necessary to make relplot work) and also makes the meaning of the parameter a bit more clear.
Changed the default diagonal plots in pairplot to use ‘func‘:kdeplot‘ when a $<$code$>$"hue"$<$/code$>$ dimension is used.
Deprecated the statistical annotation component of JointGrid. The method is still available but will be removed in a future version.
Two older functions that were deprecated in earlier versions, $<$code$>$coefplot$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$interactplot$<$/code$>$, have undergone final removal from the code base.

Documentation improvements
There has been some effort put into improving the documentation. The biggest change is that the introduction to the library has been completely rewritten to provide much more information and, critically, examples. In addition to the high-level motivation, the introduction also covers some important topics that are often sources of confusion, like the distinction between figure-level and axes-level functions, how datasets should be formatted for use in seaborn, and how to customize the appearance of the plots.
Other improvements have been made throughout, most notably a thorough re-write of the categorical tutorial categorical\_tutorial.
Other small enhancements and bug fixes

Changed rugplot to plot a matplotlib $<$code$>$LineCollection$<$/code$>$ instead of many $<$code$>$Line2D$<$/code$>$ objects, providing a big speedup for large arrays.
Changed the default off-diagonal plots to use scatterplot. (Note that the $<$code$>$"hue"$<$/code$>$ currently draws three separate scatterplots instead of using the hue semantic of the scatterplot function).
Changed color handling when using kdeplot with two variables. The default colormap for the 2D density now follows the color cycle, and the function can use $<$code$>$color$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$label$<$/code$>$ kwargs, adding more flexibility and avoiding a warning when using with multi-plot grids.
Added the $<$code$>$subplot\_kws$<$/code$>$ parameter to PairGrid for more flexibility.
Removed a special case in PairGrid that defaulted to drawing stacked histograms on the diagonal axes.
Fixed jointplot/JointGrid and regplot so that they now accept list inputs.
Fixed a bug in FacetGrid when using a single row/column level or using $<$code$>$col\_wrap=1$<$/code$>$.
Fixed functions that set axis limits so that they preserve auto-scaling state on matplotlib 2.0.
Avoided an error when using matplotlib backends that cannot render a canvas (e.g. PDF).
Changed the install infrastructure to explicitly declare dependencies in a way that $<$code$>$pip$<$/code$>$ is aware of. This means that $<$code$>$pip install seaborn$<$/code$>$ will now work in an empty environment. Additionally, the dependencies are specified with strict minimal versions.
Updated the testing infrastructure to execute tests with pytest (although many individual tests still use nose assertion).},

They show that the plasma at low heights over the central parts of an active region is hotter and denser than that which extends to greater heights. It appears that much of the emitting material exists in the form of loop structures, presumably magnetically controlled flux tubes.

Though PythonTeX was designed for Python, it may be extended to support additional languages; support for the Ruby and Julia languages is already included. PythonTeX contains a utility for converting documents into plain LaTeX, suitable for format conversion, sharing, and journal submission.}

  abstract = {Magnetograms made at Mt. Wilson Observatory from January 1967 to May 1982 are crosscorrelated in 34 latitude strips at 1-4-day increments to determine the rotation of magnetic features in the solar photosphere. The data are smoothed by averaging corresponding correlations and calculating rotation from the displacement of the averaged-correlation maximum; the usefulness and validity of this procedure are discussed. No significant time variation or field dependence is found for the period of the observations, at least to the accuracy of the calculated means (variance of from about 2 m/sec at low latitudes to about 10 m/sec near the poles). The rotation function omega at solar latitude phi is shown to be 2.902 0.464 sin sq phi - 0.328 sin to the 4th phi microrad/sec, in agreement with the Mt. Wilson Doppler profile near the poles and with the sunspot determination of Newton and Nunn (1951) at sunspot latitudes, where the Doppler estimate is about 30 m/sec slower.},

  abstract = {NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft was launched 11 February 2010 with three instruments onboard, including the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). After commissioning, HMI began normal operations on 1 May 2010 and has subsequently observed the Sun's entire visible disk almost continuously. HMI collects sequences of polarized filtergrams taken at a fixed cadence with two 4096 \texttimes{} 4096 cameras, from which are computed arcsecond-resolution maps of photospheric observables that include line-of-sight velocity and magnetic field, continuum intensity, line width, line depth, and the Stokes polarization parameters [I, Q, U, V]. Two processing pipelines have been implemented at the SDO Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC) at Stanford University to compute these observables from calibrated Level-1 filtergrams, one that computes line-of-sight quantities every 45 seconds and the other, primarily for the vector magnetic field, that computes averages on a 720-second cadence. Corrections are made for static and temporally changing CCD characteristics, bad pixels, image alignment and distortion, polarization irregularities, filter-element uncertainty and nonuniformity, as well as Sun-spacecraft velocity. We detail the functioning of these two pipelines, explain known issues affecting the measurements of the resulting physical quantities, and describe how regular updates to the instrument calibration impact them. We also describe how the scheme for computing the observables is optimized for actual HMI observations. Initial calibration of HMI was performed on the ground using a variety of light sources and calibration sequences. During the five years of the SDO prime mission, regular calibration sequences have been taken on orbit to improve and regularly update the instrument calibration, and to monitor changes in the HMI instrument. This has resulted in several changes in the observables processing that are detailed here. The instrument more than satisfies all of the original specifications for data quality and continuity. The procedures described here still have significant room for improvement. The most significant remaining systematic errors are associated with the spacecraft orbital velocity.},
