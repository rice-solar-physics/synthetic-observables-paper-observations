# Synthetic Observables II. Observations
Part 2 of a series of two papers on computing synthetic observables for various impulsive heating models. In this paper, we classify the heating frequency in our AR based on the observed timelags in the context of our synthetic observables in Paper I.

## Figures

* Observed intensity maps for all 6 channels
* Emission measure slope map
* Histogram of observed emission measure slopes overlaid on model EM slopes
* Timelag maps for all 15 channel pairs
* Classification probability maps (1x3 each so could be 1 3x3 figure)
  * EM slope
  * Timelag+cross-correlation
  * EM slope+timelag+cross-correlation
* Classification maps (i.e. heating frequency in each pixel, 1 1x3 figure)
  * EM slope
  * Timelag+cross-correlation
  * EM slope+timelag+cross-correlation
* Stacked bar chart for the three different classification schemes showing relative percentages of each heating frequency classification
